## Codex Coding Guidelines

### Editor settings

* You must use tab indentation for within each block
* Tabs should be set to equal 4 (four) spaces
* All files should be saved with UNIX (also known as LF or "\n") linefeeds, and not using the Windows linefeeds (also known as CRLF or "\r\n") or Classic Mac (also known as CR or "\r") linefeeds


### General coding style

* Use braces and not keywords (such as endif; and endwhile;)
* Braces indicating the start or end of code blocks are to be placed on their own line at all times.
* Only have one statement in a line!  Do not stack multiple statements separated by the end-of-statement character on one line!
* Long lines of code should not be wrapped onto the next line.
* Order of operations should be made explicitly clear; use parenthesis as necessary.
* Put a space between operators and values.
* Use symbolic operators instead of keyword operators
* Ternary statements are allowed for assigning values to a variable or property, or specifying parameters for a method/function.  Ternary statements are NOT mini-if statements for deciding on what methods/functions to execute!
